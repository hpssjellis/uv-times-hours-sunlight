# uv-times-hours-sunlight
Is a cities flu susceptibility correlated with the amount and intensity of sunlight? Could this be useful for the recent covid-19 outbreak. Obviously other factors are involved with the coronavirus spread.

Does anyone have any good datasets of UV and Hours of sunlight and covid-19 cases per city?

Here is what I have found so far.

I have too much time on my hands so I have been really pondering why the typical flu fades around March-April each year and a few web pages have mentioned that UV light has something to do with it. 

UV light is just intensity and does not make any sense for flu reduction with people inside buildings, herd immunity probably is more important inside, but for outside flu contamination it does make some sense. However intensity alone is probably not as important as intensity x amount of sunshine. Looking at global data that metric starts making more sense.

# Possible analysis

CovidFactor is the monthly unknown = bad luck, cultural issues (Iran:Kissing statues, Italy:close contact ) cultural positives (Japan bowing, masks when sick), prevention (Social distancing, handwashing)

UV = months average UV index
HSL = average hours of sunlight per month 
What is the covidFactor CF per city

CF x UV X SL = Cases per month per city

Quote:

 They found that the fine particles had 8.8 times more virus than the coarse particles (larger but still airborne droplets). They also tested the airborne droplets for "culturable" virus and found that virus was not only abundant in some cases, but infectious. However, there was a big range of how many viruses people put into the air some were undetectable while others put out over 100,000 every 30 minutes. 
 
 
 The researchers add, "The size of airborne particles determines how influenza virus is transmitted. Large particles (diameter, =20 µm) have limited travel distance, while smaller particles (diameter, <5 µm) stay airborne longer and spread widely. We found that up to 89 percent of influenza viruscarrying particles were <4.7 µm in diameter.
 
 Routes of flu transmission include: 1) direct or indirect (e.g., doorknobs, keyboards) contact with an infected person, 2) contact via large droplet spray from a respiratory fluid (via coughs and sneezes), and 3) inhalation of fine airborne particles, which are generated by the release of smaller, virus-containing droplets via normal breathing and coughing. 
 
 
End of quotes:

If just breathing releases very small particles of a virus that might help explain why the flu is in part reduced as the UV index increases. these very small particles might be dried out and destroyed faster with increased UV radiation?

Large particles spread by a cough or sneeze could still infect people not wearing masks and social distancing.
