# uv-times-hours-sunlight
Is a cities flu susceptibility correlated with the amount and intensity of sunlight? Could this be useful for the recent covid-19 outbreak. Obviously other factors are involved with the coronavirus spread.


Does anyone have any good datasets of UV and Hours of sounlight and covid-19 cases per city?

Here is what I have found so far

I have too much time on my hands so I have been really pondering why the typical flu fades around March-April each year and a few web pages have mentioned that UV light has something to do with it. 

UV light is just intensity and does not make any sense for flu reduction with people inside buildings, herd immunity probably is more important inside, but for outside flu contamination it does make some sense. However intensity alone is probably not as important as intensity x amount of sunshine. Looking at global data that metric starts making more sense.

CovidFactor is the monthly unknown = bad luck, cultural issues (Iran:Kissing statues, Italy:close contact ) cultural positives (Japan bowing, masks when sick), prevention (Social distancing)

UV = months average UV index
HSL = average hours of sunlight per month 
What is the covidFactor CF per city

CF x UV X SL = Cases per month per city
